      openMSX 20.0 released
    </h2>
    <p>openMSX 20.0&mdash;Autumn Spring&mdash;is a major release, in which we introduce the new Graphical User Interface, replacing the OSD menu. A faster and more powerful debugger is now included in openMSX itself. Configuration for MSX joystick/JoyMega has been improved drastically using the new GUI. If you still want to use Catapult, you can use the Catapult release that came with openMSX 19.0. Please <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openMSX/openMSX/RELEASE_20_0/doc/release-notes.txt">read the release notes</a> for details of the openMSX changes.
    </p>
    <p>Please note that as of now, a system with OpenGL 2 support is required to run openMSX.

      openMSX 19.1 released
    </h2>
    <p>openMSX 19.1&mdash;Reflection&mdash;is a bug fix release for openMSX 19.0, as we found some rather nasty issues after releasing, mostly that LaserDisc support was broken. No new Catapult will be released, as it has no changes. Please <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openMSX/openMSX/RELEASE_19_1/doc/release-notes.txt">read the release notes</a> for details of the changes. Thanks for those who gave us the feedback so that we found out about these issues.
    </p>
    <p>Reminder: please note that this will be the last release that supports systems without OpenGL 2 or later.

      openMSX 16.0 released
    </h2>
    <p>
    openMSX 16.0&mdash;Oh Shucks&mdash;is a major release in which we finally migrated to SDL2 and Tcl 8.6. And we moved to a simpler versioning scheme, stripping off that 0. prefix now :) Other than that, there are loads and loads of improvements. Some often requested ones are copy/paste functionality and drag and drop support. But we also added a super accurate YM2413 emulation (originally written by NukeYKT), fixed MIDI-in/out support on Windows, a new keyboard mode, much improved OSD menu, etc. Together with openMSX an updated version of Catapult, our user-friendly GUI, was released. We again made a small amount of improvements: fix hidden openMSX window when launching from Catapult, migration to Python 3 and wxWidgets 3.0, make supported extensions consistent with openMSX command line, replaced Accuracy control with VSync button and Min and Max Frameskip controls with fast forward speed controls and added a button to enable full speed when loading ("Fast Load").

    </h2>
    <p>
    openMSX 0.15.0&mdash;Sinterklaasphemy&mdash;is a release which was due because we did quite a lot! This time the major new stuff is support for ColecoVision (including Super Game Module and MegaCart mapper), Musical Memory Mapper and Carnivore 2. And we have fixed a lot of long-standing OPL4 emulation issues, thanks to Valley Bell. Furthermore, we overhauled the Android port, but you'll mostly notice the scale factor 2 there. And several other (sometimes very long standing) issues were fixed.Together with openMSX an updated version of Catapult, our user-friendly GUI, was released. We again made a small amount of improvements: disable controls for joystick/printer port if the machine doesn't have them, fix trashing the replay at time 0 (when reversing back to time 0), added the .hdd extension when browsing for harddisk images and made the test machine for extensions C-BIOS_MSX2+ (if available).

    </h2>
    <p>
    openMSX 0.14.0&mdash;Blasphemy&mdash;is another mix of some new features and additions and a lot of smaller fixes and improvements. This release adds support for Konami Ultimate Collection and basic emulation for the Spectravideo SVI-318 and SVI-328 pre-MSX computers, increases FDC accuracy in such a way that we think all copy protections (captured in a DMK file) should now run in openMSX. Moreover, we now put the SDLGL-PP renderer as the default, so let us know how that works for you. You can of course always set the old default setting for your system if you don't like SDLGL-PP. But then we would really like to know why... We also removed the Windows DirectX sound driver, as it was buggy and caused a lot of complaints. And finally, we added a button in the top left corner to easily invoke the OSD menu.Together with openMSX an updated version of Catapult, our user-friendly GUI, was released. We again made a small amount of improvements: added noise control to Video Control Page, fixed the browse extension for the openMSX executable and some build support improvements.

    </h2>
    <p>
    openMSX 0.13.0&mdash;Black Cat&mdash;again was meant to be (mostly) a bug fix release, but again it also has some nice additions and improvements to enjoy. Important improvements are much better support for VDP I/O delay in turbo machines (fixing graphics issues due to too fast VDP access there), more accurate MSX1 color palette, progress reporting for long operations and ALSA MIDI-out support for Linux. This is also one of the first releases that drops support for older platforms: Windows XP, Dingoo A320 (but introducing support for GCW Zero) and non-64-bit MacOSX. If you still want to run openMSX on these, you'll be stuck on using a previous release or start maintaining these platforms yourself. Together with openMSX an updated version of Catapult, our user-friendly GUI, was released. We again made a small amount of improvements: fixed Catapult interrupting replay directly after loading it, performance improvements while reversing, fixed drag-and-drop for media and some smaller bug fixes.

    <p>
    openMSX 0.12.0&mdash;Mulligan&mdash;was going to be (mostly) a bug fix release. But at the end we also got inspired by Grauw to add a lot of MIDI devices. And, reviewing what we changed the last 10 months, we saw that we also got loads of help from several people to add many new machine configurations and added some fun stuff like Sensor Kid and (experimental) Beer IDE emulation. On the emulator features category we give you stuff like triplesize video recording, some TAS enhancements and a callback for too fast VRAM access. So, enjoy this 'various features and bug fixes' release! Together with openMSX an updated version of Catapult, our user-friendly GUI, was released. We again made a small amount of improvements: no need to specify the share dir anymore, automatically fetch the list of supported mappers from openMSX, fix handling of MIDI connectors and some small bug fixes.

Our GitHub project page (where you can find the code and the ticket system) is at <a href="https://github.com/openMSX/">https://github.com/openMSX/</a> and the official URL of our web site is now <a href="http://openmsx.org/">http://openmsx.org</a>.

    openMSX 0.11.0&mdash;NotOneButDoubleOne&mdash;brings you the following important new features: VDP access timing now also for MSX1 modes (corruption with too fast VRAM access will be visible now), implementation of most defailed differences between all used VDP chips and emulation of MegaFlashROM SCC+ SD. On top of that, there are some important (long standing) bug fixes, like the proper implementation of envelopes for MSX-AUDIO, fixing for example "Copy is Crime" by Impact. And last but not least, a lot of work was done under the bonnet, giving you even better performance and preparations for the future. Together with openMSX an updated version of Catapult, our user-friendly GUI, was released. We only made some minor improvements to it this time.

Together with openMSX an updated version of Catapult, our user-friendly GUI, was released. Again, we actually made some improvements to it this time, mostly more code cleanups to enable quite some bug fixes (mainly in the settings tab), but also some features, like ability to change cartridges at run time and support for hard disks.

    </h2>
    <p>
    Today we moved all openMSX projects to Git (still on SourceForge.net), after having used Subversion for about 6 and a half years. Git is now the state of the art on source code management and rapidly getting more popular. Anyway, this means that you have to use a different way to get the latest openMSX sources now: click on <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/openmsx/_list/git">one of the repos</a> to see the instructions at the top. The Subversion repository will be deleted soon. Also, we've converted the project on SF.net from classic to Allura. You'll notice that when visiting <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/openmsx/">the project page</a>, especially when you check the new Tickets system, e.g. the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/openmsx/bugs/">bug tracker</a>.

We removed the snapshot of Catapult, because Catapult as has been released so far is pronounced dead. A rewrite using Python and Qt4 is in the works though. You can get a snapshot of that project, instead.

    Other news that we forgot to post here: there is a universal binary available for Mac OS X users, see the download section.

     <h2>

      openMSX 0.6.1 released
    </h2>
    <p>
    openMSX 0.6.1&mdash;Chernoton Meltdown&mdash;includes runtime switchable machines and extensions, a lot of new video filters (some of which use pixel shaders), as well as a lot of other improvements and bugfixes. Together with openMSX a new version of Catapult, our user-friendly GUI, was released. Please <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=435794&amp;group_id=38274">read the release notes</a> for details.

    <h2>
      <span class="date">2006 July 23</span>
      Web site restyled
    </h2>
    <p>
      A redesign of the openMSX web site was long overdue. And with the
      restructuring of the site, we've also included 2 different layouts.
      Hurray for CSS :-)

    <h2>
      <span class="date">2006 July 23</span>
      openMSX needs <em>you</em>!
    </h2>
    <p>
      That is, if you've got some spare time and want to develop
      fun software for Windows. The openMSX team desperately needs Windows
      developers, both for coding on the openMSX code itself, and also for
      Catapult. Don't hesitate! Fire up you IRC client and visit us at
      #openmsx on Freenode.net. We won't bite. Really!
