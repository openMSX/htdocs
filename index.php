      openMSX 0.12.0 released
    </h2>
    <p>
    openMSX 0.12.0&mdash;Mulligan&mdash;was going to be (mostly) a bug fix release. But at the end we also got inspired by Grauw to add a lot of MIDI devices. And, reviewing what we changed the last 10 months, we saw that we also got loads of help from several people to add many new machine configurations and added some fun stuff like Sensor Kid and (experimental) Beer IDE emulation. On the emulator features category we give you stuff like triplesize video recording, some TAS enhancements and a callback for too fast VRAM access. So, enjoy this 'various features and bug fixes' release! Together with openMSX an updated version of Catapult, our user-friendly GUI, was released. We again made a small amount of improvements: no need to specify the share dir anymore, automatically fetch the list of supported mappers from openMSX, fix handling of MIDI connectors and some small bug fixes. Please <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openMSX/openMSX/RELEASE_0_12_0/doc/release-notes.txt">read the release notes</a> for details of the openMSX changes.

      openMSX on the move
    </h2>
    <p>
    As some core openMSX developers felt uncomfortable at SourceForge.net given the <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/05/sourceforge-grabs-gimp-for-windows-account-wraps-installer-in-bundle-pushing-adware/">recent events</a>, we decided to say goodbye to them after 14 years. So far we have moved our code and tickets to GitHub and our website to private hosting. With that, please update your git clones and links to our website! Our GitHub project page (where you can find the code and the ticket system) is at <a href="https://github.com/openMSX/">https://github.com/openMSX/</a> and the official URL of our web site is now <a href="http://openmsx.org/">http://openmsx.org</a>. The coming weeks we will see if and how we will move the rest of our stuff off of SourceForge.net.

      openMSX 0.11.0 released
    </h2>
    <p>
    openMSX 0.11.0&mdash;NotOneButDoubleOne&mdash;brings you the following important new features: VDP access timing now also for MSX1 modes (corruption with too fast VRAM access will be visible now), implementation of most defailed differences between all used VDP chips and emulation of MegaFlashROM SCC+ SD. On top of that, there are some important (long standing) bug fixes, like the proper implementation of envelopes for MSX-AUDIO, fixing for example "Copy is Crime" by Impact. And last but not least, a lot of work was done under the bonnet, giving you even better performance and preparations for the future. Together with openMSX an updated version of Catapult, our user-friendly GUI, was released. We only made some minor improvements to it this time.

      openMSX 0.10.1 released
    </h2>
    <p>
    openMSX 0.10.1&mdash;StillNotOneToo&mdash;mostly fixes bugs we introduced with 0.10.0 or were already present for a bit longer... sorry for those, but most should be fixed now :) There are also some small but nice additions, like much extended MIDI support on Mac (thanks Grauw!), support for harddisk images in the OSD menu and more fine grained control in which slots carts and extensions will end up. Together with openMSX an updated version of Catapult, our user-friendly GUI, was released. Again, we actually made some improvements to it this time, mostly more code cleanups to enable quite some bug fixes (mainly in the settings tab), but also some features, like ability to change cartridges at run time and support for hard disks.

      openMSX 0.10.0 released
    </h2>
    <p>
    openMSX 0.10.0&mdash;StillNotOne&mdash;adds many larger and smaller features, but most outstanding are: cycle accurate VDP command engine timing, an Android port, subdirectory support for dir-as-disk and Neos MA-20 support. These features meant a lot of work was done in practically all parts of the code, but at the same time we also freshened up much of the code using many of the new C++11 language features. All in all, it was time to release this stuff officially... Together with openMSX an updated version of Catapult, our user-friendly GUI, was released. We actually made some improvements to it this time, mostly code cleanups to make it easier to help us with this subproject, but also some small features, like ability to set up multiple IPS files, control video source and disable sprite settings and DMK support in the file filters, next to some smaller bug fixes.

      openMSX moves to Git
    </h2>
    <p>
    Today we moved all openMSX projects to Git (still on SourceForge.net), after having used Subversion for about 6 and a half years. Git is now the state of the art on source code management and rapidly getting more popular. Anyway, this means that you have to use a different way to get the latest openMSX sources now: click on <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/openmsx/_list/git">one of the repos</a> to see the instructions at the top. The Subversion repository will be deleted soon. Also, we've converted the project on SF.net from classic to Allura. You'll notice that when visiting <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/openmsx/">the project page</a>, especially when you check the new Tickets system, e.g. the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/openmsx/bugs/">bug tracker</a>.

    <p>
    openMSX 0.9.1&mdash;Enigma Take Two&mdash;mostly fixes a bug in dir-as-disk that was introduced in openMSX 0.9.0, when adding support for the DMK format and low level disk emulation. We not only fixed that bug, we rewrote dir-as-disk almost completely, making it a lot more robust. Together with openMSX an updated version of Catapult, our user-friendly GUI, was released.

    <p>
    openMSX 0.8.1&mdash;Tasmania&mdash;builds on the previous release, in the sense that we worked out the features a little more. We added a lot of scripts to help you with Tool Assisted Speedruns (TAS), one of the reasons openMSX got <a href="http://tasvideos.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=249886#249886">officially approved</a> as a TAS capable emulator on <a href="http://tasvideos.org/">tasvideos.org</a>.

      openMSX 0.8.0 released
    </h2>
    <p>
    openMSX 0.8.0&mdash;CSI Dresal&mdash;includes two major new features: reverse and Laserdisc. Reverse is similar to what you can do in meisei: you can 'rewind' time with your finger tip, to correct game playing mistakes or inspect what caused a crash. Laserdisc is the Palcom system introduced by Pioneer in 1984: now you can play all the Palcom MSX Laserdisc games in openMSX! With this release we also provide a first official binary package for Dingux on your Dingoo hand held. For the rest we have mostly fixed smaller issues and added smaller features.

    </h2>
    <p>
    Oops, we found a problem in openMSX 0.7.1, just after we had released it... Due to a small bug in a Tcl script,
openMSX wasn't able to load savestates with paths that contain spaces, which is the most common case on standard Windows installations. 0.7.2 will be available very soon to fix that.

This means smaller binaries and also support for 64-bit Windows operating systems. Also, several long standing problems have been fixed in the Windows release of openMSX. E.g., it now includes full support for unicode! For the rest we have mostly fixed smaller issues and added some cool demonstrations of what one can do with the combination of (Tcl) scripting, the debug command and the OSD.

      No Windows support anymore?? 
    </h2>
    <p>
    We've said it before: we need someone in our team to help us maintain the Windows port of openMSX. At the moment there is no one who provides us structural support for the Windows port. Without a person who can very regularly build and test openMSX and help in case of (rare) Windows specific issues, we cannot maintain the Windows port any longer. We may find a way to build the next release, but even that is uncertain; if we can manage, it will most likely be released (much) later than the Source and Mac versions.

      openMSX moves to Subversion
    </h2>
    <p>
    Today we moved the main openMSX project to Subversion (SVN). This means that you have to use a different way to get the latest openMSX sources now. It is explained in the updated online manual, in the <a href="http://openmsx.sf.net/manual/compile.html">Compilation Guide</a>. Snapshots are now also taken from SVN. We removed the snapshot of Catapult, because Catapult as has been released so far is pronounced dead. A rewrite using Python and Qt4 is in the works though. You can get a snapshot of that project, instead.
    </p>
    <p>
    Other news that we forgot to post here: there is a universal binary available for Mac OS X users, see the download section.

      That is, if you've got some spare time and want to develop
      fun software for Windows. The openMSX team desperately needs Windows
      developers, both for coding on the openMSX code itself, and also for
      Catapult. Don't hesitate! Fire up you IRC client and visit us at
