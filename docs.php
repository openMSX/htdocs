      </dt>
      <dd>
        openMSX is an emulator for the MSX home computer system. Its goal is to emulate all
        aspects of the MSX with 100% accuracy: perfection in emulation. 
	You can find everything you ever wanted to know about MSX, and more, in
        <a href="http://faq.msxnet.org/">the Ultimate MSX FAQ</a>.

        Nothing, actually. Your openMSX is running a machine named 'C-BIOS'.
        <a href="http://cbios.sourceforge.net/">C-BIOS</a> is a free BIOS
        for MSX, which&mdash;like openMSX&mdash;is still in development, and
        therefore doesn't provide all functionality to run a complete MSX
        machine, yet. <br />
	<br />
	It can, however, still load and run ROM files,
	such as homebrew games obtained from the 
	<a href="https://www.msxdev.org/">MSXdev competition</a>, or
	<a href="https://www.msx.org/wiki/Copying_cartridge_software">dumped</a>
	from your own cartridges.<br />
	To run these files, just drag-and-drop them onto the open openMSX
	window or shortcut, or watch this video showcasing one of the other 
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7nPJdsRaRM">ways to load ROMs</a>.<br />

      <dt class="toc"><a href="/manual/compile.html">Compilation Guide</a></dt>
      <dd>
        This guide describes how you can get the openMSX sources and compile
        them. If you downloaded a binary release, you can skip this.

      <dt class="toc"><a href="/manual/setup.html">Setup Guide</a></dt>
      <dd>
        This guide describes how you can configure openMSX to emulate
        actual MSX machines.  It also describes how you can have openMSX
        start up with your personal settings, how you can configure openMSX
        and your system for optimal performance, and several other
        configuration related topics.

      <dt class="toc"><a href="/manual/user.html">User's Manual</a></dt>

        it is fully running.

      <dt class="toc"><a class="external" href="/manual/commands.html">Console Command Reference</a></dt>
      <dd>
      An overview of all commands and settings that can be used from the openMSX built in console. Check this if you want to know exactly how to control openMSX. Because the current openMSX Catapult GUI is running behind in functionality, it is also useful to read this for some common settings not supported in Catapult yet.

      <dt class="toc"><a class="external" href="/manual/diskmanipulator.html">Diskmanipulator</a></dt>
      <dd>
      The <code>diskmanipulator</code> command is so powerful that we made a separate
      manual for it. Use it to create (hard)disk images, import files to them, export
      files from them, etc.
