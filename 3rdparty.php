        An openMSX version of the blueMSX Launcher, mostly targeted at
        launching games. It supports screenshots for games and a large number
        of languages. Multiplatform: Windows, Mac, Linux, BSD.
        Development has stopped and development efforts are now concentrated on
        Novo Player.

          Novo Player is a new, versatile, multi-platform front-end designed
          primarily for openMSX and is currently very much under active
          development. Currently, the <a href="http://msxlaunchers.info/download.html">
          latest version is 1.10.1</a>.

        Because the old style Catapult does not run (properly) on Mac,
        an active Japanese emulator user/programmer wrote an
        <a href="https://nekocanmac.up.seesaa.net/image/NekoLauncheropenMSX_v15.zip">
        openMSX variant of his NekoLauncher</a> series. It's not only getting more and
        more advanced, but also seems to be very user friendly.

      <dd>
        For the same reason, Cesco made another launcher for openMSX on OS X.
        It seemed to be focused mainly on games and features image previews.
        Unfortunately, the site and download links have disappeared.

        FiXato created a great web site which provides you with daily built
        binaries of openMSX. Very much recommended if you want to try out
        development versions of openMSX without compiling them yourself!
        Currently supporting Windows, macOS, Android and OpenDingux platforms.
        Unfortunately, the disk space seems to have run full and it no longer
        hosts recent builds.

        Rafael Jannone made an interesting thing: a plugin for Gedit, so that
        you can easily test your MSX Basic programs in openMSX, while using
        the Gedit text editor. He wrote a whole load of Python scripts to
        make this possible. They might be nice to reuse for other apps!
