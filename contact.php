        A more modern alternative to IRC (see below), with an IRC bridge,
        as not all openMSX developers are on Discord (yet).
        Same as IRC: don't hesitate to visit, don't hesitate to ask anything
        openMSX related.  Remarks, suggestions, ideas are most welcome!

      <dd>
        Note that we are not reading Discord 24 hours per day, so if no-one responds, please stick around or try again later.

        SourceForge hosts a number of mailing lists for openMSX.
        None of these mailing lists is high-volume; expect just a couple
        of messages per week. In practice, IRC has replaced these mailing
        lists.
